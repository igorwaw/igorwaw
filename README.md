## Hi, I'm Igor. 
An IT engineer interested in Linux, IoT and all the geeky stuff. This github account is for my private things - experiments, learning, 
side projects etc. Nothing to do with my day job. 

Currently all repos are private. This might change in future when I feel that a project reached enough quality to share it.

## List of repos
* [Ansible](https://github.com/igorwaw/ansible) - copy of my playbooks
* [Arduino Laser Harp](https://github.com/igorwaw/laserharp) - Laser harp with Arduino
* [Go Learn](https://github.com/igorwaw/golearn) - my early experiments with Go, really nothing to see here
