## Hi, I'm Igor. 
An IT engineer interested in Linux, IoT and all the geeky stuff. This github account is for my private things - experiments, learning, 
side projects etc. Nothing to do with my day job.

## List of public repos
* [Advent 15](https://github.com/igorwaw/advent15) - Advent of Code 2015
* [Advent 16](https://github.com/igorwaw/advent16) - Advent of Code 2016
* [Advent 22](https://github.com/igorwaw/advent22) - Advent of Code 2022
* [Project Euler](https://github.com/igorwaw/euler) - Project Euler

Also my personal website repos (everything that starts with web-) are public - no need to hide the source if the result is publicly visible! 

## List of private repos
* [Ansible](https://github.com/igorwaw/ansible) - copy of my playbooks
* [Arduino Laser Harp](https://github.com/igorwaw/laserharp) - Laser harp with Arduino
* [PyLearn](https://github.com/igorwaw/pylearn) - Python experiments and code snippets
* [GoLearn](https://github.com/igorwaw/golearn) - experiments with Go, hello world stage
* [Twitoot](https://github.com/igorwaw/twitoot) - command line client for Twitter and Mastodon, early stage

Currently these repos are private because the code is low quality or only useful to me. This might change in future when I feel that a project reached enough quality to share it.
